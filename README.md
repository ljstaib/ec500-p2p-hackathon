## Overview

For this hackathon, we created a peer to peer chat application which uses the command line. Our repository has two files: "clientP2P.py" and "serverP2P.py". The only difference between the two is that one user binds a socket for the second user connects to that socket ("serverP2P.py" binds the socket and "clientP2P.py" connects). We use Python sockets to connect between each user and MongoDB to store messages locally and store name/IP combinations in MongoDB Atlas.

## Design

### Discovery

#### Centralized MongoDB Atlas

#### Auto updating IPV4

### P2P Messaging

#### Local Message Storage

#### Python Sockets for P2P Transfer
